# ðŸ¤– Chatbot-Bootstrap ðŸ¤–


## What is it?

A Chatbot Bootsrap-Kit based on [Meteor](https://github.com/meteor/meteor) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com). 
We have seen a lot of platforms for chatbots, but what about if you just want your bot running on your website?
This is exactly what this project is for.
It's a simple web-project which is pretty easy to get it up and running. It currently offers API interfaces for API.ai and motion.ai. 
In addition it has a built in tracking view where you can see all recent conversations.
